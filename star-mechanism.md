### **Updated Theory of the Star Mechanism**  

**Concept:**  
The **Star Mechanism** is a rare, high-level combat technique that temporarily grants access to **seven powerful combination moves**. These techniques surpass natural mana limitations, allowing users to execute abilities far beyond their usual capabilities for a limited time.  

However, there exists an **8th move**, a fusion of **one Basic Mana and one Forbidden Mana**, that remains a mystery. It is considered the ultimate manifestation of the Star Mechanism, but unlocking it is an almost impossible feat.

## **Unlocking the Star Mechanism**  
To activate the **Star Mechanism**, a user must meet strict requirements:  

1. **Full Mastery of Two or Three Basic Mana Types** – The user must have complete control over their mana flow and be able to merge energies seamlessly.  
2. **Physical & Mental Endurance** – The strain of wielding these techniques is immense. Only those with refined bodies and unbreakable willpower can handle the backlash.  
3. **Special Engraved Mark (Star Inscription)** – A rare marking appears on those who have undergone extreme mana evolution. This mark serves as a conduit for activating the **Star Mechanism**.

## **The 7 Fixed Star Mechanism Moves (Advanced Combination Mana Techniques)**  
These seven moves are the pinnacle of **non-forbidden** mana fusion, allowing for powerful combat techniques.  

1. **Celestial Tempest (Wind + Lightning + Gravity)**  
   - A high-speed **storm infused with lightning and enhanced gravitational force**, making it nearly impossible to evade or counter.  

2. **Infernal Maelstrom (Fire + Wind + Metal)**  
   - A **spinning vortex of superheated wind and molten metal shards**, capable of melting through any defense.  

3. **Glacial Tomb (Ice + Water + Crystal)**  
   - A technique that **freezes the enemy inside an unbreakable crystalline prison**, sealing them in eternal stasis.  

4. **Terra Collapse (Earth + Metal + Quake)**  
   - A seismic force that **fractures the battlefield**, pulling enemies into an abyss while **magnetic debris** crushes them from above.  

5. **Bloodstorm Requiem (Blood + Wind + Sound)**  
   - Generates **razor-sharp blood waves** vibrating at sonic speed, forming an unavoidable slicing storm.  

6. **Eclipse Fang (Light + Shadow + Space Distortion)**  
   - Bends **light and shadow** simultaneously, allowing the user to teleport unpredictably and release cutting energy waves from distorted dimensions.  

7. **Venomous Hellrain (Toxin + Water + Storm)**  
   - Calls forth **acidic rain mixed with poisonous lightning**, causing **continuous corrosion and nerve damage** upon contact.

## **The 8th Move – A Forbidden Secret**  
The **8th move of the Star Mechanism** is **not accessible through normal means** and is considered **a legend even among Star Mechanism users**. It is the only move that fuses a **Basic Mana Type with a Forbidden Mana Type**, making it the most dangerous technique in existence.  

### **How to Unlock the 8th Move**  
The process of unlocking the **8th move** is **extremely difficult and will only be achieved by one or two characters in the entire story**. The requirements are:  

1. **Mastery Over All 7 Star Mechanism Moves** – The user must have complete control over the existing **Star Mechanism techniques** to prove their strength.  
2. **Understanding of Both the Basic and Forbidden Mana Type** – Unlike the other seven moves, the **8th move fuses a normal element with a forbidden power**, requiring **absolute control over both.**  
3. **Surviving a Near-Death Awakening** – The **Star Mechanism alone cannot unlock the 8th move**. It is said that only a warrior who **faces death and overcomes it through sheer willpower** can awaken the hidden technique.   
4. **Withstanding the Forbidden Backlash** – Unlike the previous seven moves, the **8th move is not meant to exist naturally**. Its activation can cause the user’s **body to decay** if they are not strong enough to control it.

## **Who First Discovered the Star Mechanism?**  
The **origin of the Star Mechanism** is surrounded by myth, but legends speak of **a celestial warrior known as Astralis Seraphis**, a figure from ancient history who first unlocked the seven moves. However, it is **unclear whether Astralis unlocked the 8th move or perished trying.** Some believe the **truth about the 8th move** is hidden in ancient ruins or texts waiting to be uncovered.

### **Final Notes**  
- The **7 moves are known among high-level warriors** but remain **incredibly difficult to master.**  
- The **8th move is a forgotten legend**, and **only one or two characters will ever unlock it in the entire story.**
